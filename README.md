# Todo C++ Project

This project is going to be, initiially, a ToDo list for the command line.
After the basic ToDo class has been written, command line aguments will be used to run the various commands.
Something along the lines of Gentoo Linux's 'news' application, which uses commands such as 'news read' or 'news list'
